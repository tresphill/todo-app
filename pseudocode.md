# Concerns

# PRECEPT
parameters - based on requirements, functionality 
returns - an app that allows a user to input tasks and render them in a list
examples - i dont have any bc if i did that would be cheating
concerns - see list above
explain - 
* i need to create an app that allows a user to input tasks and see them listed
* it will need to have functionality so tasks can be added/deleted
* it will need some sort of indicator that tasks have been completed (strikethrough)
* it will need selectors like "all, completed, to-do"
positive self talk - you have all the resources at hand, dont be afraid to ask for help when stuck, you are driven by discomfort
translate - my app will speak for itself
